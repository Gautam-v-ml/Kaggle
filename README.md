# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
In this challenge, we are going to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.
The training set is used to build machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.
The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
